# SeveregamingZA Website

I have a huge passion for eSports, especially for DOTA 2 and thought it would be a great way and opportunity to learn Django and Python by creating a website for Severe Gaming, a multi-gaming organization that I used to manage and play for.

This project will always be close to my heart since this was my first 'big project'. I've learned so much by making this website.
